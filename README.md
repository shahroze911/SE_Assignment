In this project,this is a dip assignment in which geometric mean,harmonic mean and arithmetic mean are calculated using 
dip concepts.Geometric means calculate the central number in a geometric progression (e.g. 9 in 3, 9, 27), also calculable
 as the nth root of a product of n numbers.In mathematics, the harmonic mean (sometimes called the subcontrary mean) is one 
of several kinds of average, and in particular, one of the Pythagorean means. Typically, it is appropriate for situations
when the average of rates is desired.Arithmetic mean calculate the average of a set of numerical values, as calculated by 
adding them together and dividing by the number of terms in the set.
In these python Files actually there is image processing on different images to free them from noises and make then smooth and clear.
